          I belive that tomorrows apps will be built by people who can't write a
          line of code.

          I believe in solving the energy challenges of our time so
          that future generations don't have to worry about where their energy comes
          from.

          I hope to achieve this by engineering simple-to-use products and
          services to allow anybody to participate in a smarter and more sustainable
          future.
